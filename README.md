**Welcome to the Debugging Section**

Take a look at the `cs131_debug.c` file! The function `find_range` isn't doing what it claims to be doing (check out its function comments). **There are 2 major bugs with the function -- your task is to fix `find_range` such that it behaves according to its function comments! Comment the code with an explanation of what the bug was and how you fixed it"**

Feel free to rewrite anything in find_range (even the function signature if you'd like to). If you do change the function signature, make sure to change its function call in main accordingly. Other than that, please don't make any other changes to the file.

We've also provided one test. If you passed the test, you'll see the words "You passed the test!" printed. Note that this test is certainly not exhaustive, so make sure to think of edge cases to ensure that the function is working as expected.

**Compile & Run**

Compile `cs131_debug.c` on the department machines using: `gcc -Wall cs131_debug.c -g -o cs131_debug`
Run cs131_debug: `./cs131_debug`

Good luck, and please email us at [shaileja_jain@brown.edu](mailto:shaileja_jain@brown.edu) or [malte@cs.brown.edu](mailto:malte@cs.brown.edu) if you have any questions.
